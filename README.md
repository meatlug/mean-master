## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager

### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get MEAN.js is to use git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/meatlug/mean-master.git
```
# Install
To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```
## Running The Application
Running application using npm with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
This will start the application in development mode and open the browser and enter the url as [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

That's it! The application should be running.

### Running in Production mode
To run the application with *production* environment configuration:

```bash
$ npm run start
```
